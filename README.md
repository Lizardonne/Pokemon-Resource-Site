# Pokemon Resource Site
 Resource webpage for Pokemon games and gameplay.

## The basic requirements are:
 * The site uses Vue and the Vue CLI
 * The site has at least three pages
 * The site has some mock data that is at least as detailed as the mock data used in the prior lab.
 * The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository

## We will grade your projects based on:
 * you used Vue and the Vue CLI for the entire site
 * you have three pages
 * you have detailed mock data
  *how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.

## TAs will assign scores in these ranges:
 * 90-100: Excellent use of Vue, clearly follows web design principles
 * 80-90: Uses Vue, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
 * 70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue, but does not make a strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles
